## 🎨 Design Approach

### Professional & Subtle
- Not intrusive or distracting
- Matches the app's existing design language
- Prominent on the About page (where people expect to see creator info)
- Minimal but visible in the sidebar

### Consistent Branding
- Uses the same purple/violet gradient as TraceRight
- "T" logo placeholder that matches the app icon style
- Responsive hover effects
- Works perfectly in both light and cyberpunk modes

### Clickable Links
All links open in new tabs and include proper attributes:
- `target="_blank"` - Opens in new tab
- `rel="noopener noreferrer"` - Security best practice

# üåç Universal Trace Cloud - Global Traceability Platform

> **"Traceability is the river. Supply chain is the ocean."**

---

## üéØ Vision

**TraceRight** has evolved into **Universal Trace Cloud** - a global, multi-industry traceability platform that serves companies from Buff City Soap to automotive manufacturers, from electronics to pharmaceuticals.

### The River & Ocean Metaphor

**üåä Traceability = The River**
- The clear, continuous **flow of information**
- Begins at the source (raw materials, components)
- Flows through every touchpoint (production, quality, distribution)
- Carries transparency, direction, and proof of origin
- Narrow but precise - you can follow from beginning to end

**üåç Supply Chain = The Ocean**
- The vast, **interconnected ecosystem**
- Contains many rivers of traceability
- Deep, complex, full of interacting currents
- Global trade, regulations, demand, logistics
- The ocean's health depends on clear rivers

**Together**: Without traceability (the river), the supply chain (the ocean) becomes murky and impossible to navigate. With clear traceability flows, the entire system becomes transparent and manageable.

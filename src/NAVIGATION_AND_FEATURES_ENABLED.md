# 🎯 Navigation & Features - ALL ENABLED

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
When clicking on **Production** and **Intelligence** sections in the sidebar, no menu items were visible.

### Root Cause
The application was originally designed with a **tiered/crowdfunding** feature flag system. Most features were disabled by default and locked behind paid tiers.

### Solution
**All features are now ENABLED by default** in `/components/FeatureFlagsContext.tsx`

## 🔧 Feature Flags System

### Current Setting: **ALL ENABLED**

The feature flags in `/components/FeatureFlagsContext.tsx` now default to **true** for all major features.

### If You Want to Re-Enable Tiered Access

To use the crowdfunding/tier system:

1. **Open Feature Flags Manager**
   - Click "🎛️ Feature Flags" in sidebar
   - Select a tier (Free, Starter, Professional, Enterprise, Ultimate)
   - Features will automatically enable/disable based on tier

2. **Tier Breakdown:**
   - **Free**: Dashboard, Logistics, Suppliers, About
   - **Starter**: + Purchase Orders, Inbound, Warehouse, Raw Materials, Recipes, Batches
   - **Professional**: + Outbound, Traceability, AI Reporting, Dashboards, Sheets
   - **Enterprise**: + AI Forecast, Materials Intel, ML Intelligence, Advanced features
   - **Ultimate**: Everything unlocked

### Manual Control

Edit `/components/FeatureFlagsContext.tsx` line ~357:

```typescript
const defaultFeatureFlags: FeatureFlags = {
  // Set any feature to false to hide it
  rawMaterials: true,   // Change to false to hide
  recipes: true,        // Change to false to hide
  // ... etc
};
```
